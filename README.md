# Citrix Workspace for Linux (Icaclient) SSL Script 

This script replaces the cacerts folder from the icaclient with a symlink to the system certificate folder.

***Use at your own risk!

Currently working on:

- Ubuntu 21.10
- (MAYBE other Debian based Distributions, because they're all using the same installation package...)
